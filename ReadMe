📊 Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)
This project is a dynamic and interactive Sales Performance Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel, designed to analyze and visualize key business metrics from a fictional Superstore dataset. The dashboard provides deep insights into sales, profit, customer behavior, and regional performance, all structured for business decision-making.

✅ Ideal for beginners who want to learn Excel analytics, or recruiters evaluating entry-level data analysts.

🧠 Objective of the Project
To simulate the role of a Business Analyst or Excel Data Analyst by creating a professional dashboard that:

Monitors key performance indicators (KPIs)

Identifies trends across time, regions, and product categories

Enables decision-making using filters (slicers) and interactive visuals

📁 Project Structure
➤ Superstore_Data.xlsx
This is the raw dataset that includes:

Order ID, Product Name, Category, Sub-category

Sales Amount, Profit, Quantity

Region, State, Customer Name

Order Date, Ship Mode

It mimics real-world sales data typically used by e-commerce or retail businesses.

➤ Sales_Dashboard_Excel.xlsx
This is the final dashboard file containing:

Cleaned and structured data (no code, all Excel formulas)

Pivot Tables for aggregation

Pivot Charts for visuals

Slicers for user-friendly filtering

Conditional formatting for visual emphasis

🔍 Key Features of the Dashboard
🔹 1. Key Metrics (KPIs)
The top section of the dashboard shows:

Total Sales – Total revenue generated

Total Profit – Net profit across all orders

Total Quantity Sold – Units sold

Average Profit per Order

✅ All KPIs are auto-updated based on slicer selection (dynamic filtering).

🔹 2. Sales by Region
A Pivot Chart (Column Chart) shows how each region contributes to total sales.

Helps identify high-performing and underperforming regions.

Useful for market expansion or resource allocation strategies.

🔹 3. Monthly Sales Trends
A Pivot Line Chart visualizes Sales by Month.

Shows seasonality, spikes, or dips in sales.

Helps identify promotional impact or time-based trends.

🔹 4. Product Category & Sub-Category Analysis
Bar chart comparing Sales and Profit by Category

Drill-down into Sub-Categories to find which products drive revenue or profit.

Helps in stock planning or discount strategies.

🔹 5. Top Customers
A Pivot Table ranks customers by total purchases.

Helps identify loyal or high-value customers.

Enables targeted marketing or loyalty rewards planning.

🔹 6. Interactive Slicers
Filters added for:

Region

Category

Month

Ship Mode

Clicking a slicer filters the entire dashboard — very useful for business users.
